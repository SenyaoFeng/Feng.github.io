*  The project is committed to revealing the mutual feeding mechanism of hydrological process and ecological process under environmental changes in typical fragile ecological areas.
*  Researching the coupling driving mechanism and simulation method of ecological-hydrological process, and building a comprehensive technical system integrating risk identification, assessment, prediction and forecasting.
*  Early warning, put forward a coordinated plan for comprehensive water management of "mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass, and sand" and a stable and moderate coordination plan to coordinate and improve the carrying capacity of resources, water, environment, and water ecology.
