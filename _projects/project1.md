The upper Yellow River basin over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important ecological barrier in northwestern China. Effective LULC products that enable the monitoring of changes in regional ecosystem types are of great importance for their environmental protection and macro-control. The project combined an 18-class LULC classification scheme based on ecosystem types with Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data, the GEE platform, and the RF machine learning method to present new high-resolution LULC products with a spatial resolution of 10 m for the upper Yellow River basin over the TP and conducted monitoring of changes in ecosystem types.

*  Provide effective data support for the monitoring of regional scale ecosystem types, quality assessments and protection, natural resource management, and sustainable development of the upper Yellow River basin over the TP.
