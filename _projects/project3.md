*  Establish a vertical monitoring transect of Xianmi Forest Farm-Lenglongling Typical Ecosystem in Qilian Mountains National Park.
*  The area is 2,600-5,254 m above sea level, with an elevation span of more than 2,000 m, constituting an obvious and complete vertical spectrum of mountain vegetation and soil, which is the epitome of the biodiversity of Qilian Mountains.
*  It is an ideal place to study the impact of climate and environmental changes on the vertical distribution pattern of biodiversity and the formation mechanism.
*  According to the types of vegetation, six long-term permanent monitoring plots of 20m√ó20m were established in typical forests, shrubs, meadows, grasslands, sparse vegetation belts of alpine flowstone slopes and glacial snow belts.
*  Explore the migration rules of the forest-shrub ecotone, shrub-grass ecotone, and snow line in the vertical zone under the background of climate change, and clarify the driving mechanism of the typical ecosystem structure and function changes in the vertical zone of Qilian Mountain National Park and the response to global climate change.
